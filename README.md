# Credits
The framework is entirely being developed by me, w3ryfrate, with the help of the following external libraries:
- [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET)
- [StbImageSharp](https://github.com/StbSharp/StbImageSharp)
- [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)
# Disclaimer
Atlantide is still in its earliest development stages and is not meant to develop a commercial product, neither is it buildable on any machine. For feature-rich C# frameworks that target 2D and 3D graphics, see:
- [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame)
